In essence, Active Directory functions as a network phonebook that makes it simple to find and manage devices.</h3>

<h2> Step 1 <h2>Choose a physical or virtual machine to install Windows Server on. Make sure it meets the system requirements for Windows Server.

<h2> Step 3 <h2>Configure a static IP address for the machine. You can do this by going to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > right-click on your network adapter > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties. Enter the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses.
